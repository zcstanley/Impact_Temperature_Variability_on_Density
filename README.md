# Impact_Temperature_Variability_on_Density
This repo contains code used for the paper "Parameterizing the impact of unresolved temperature variability on the large scale density field Part I: Theory."
by Z. Stanley,  I. Grooms, W. Kleiber, S. D. Bachman, F. Castruccio, and A. Adcroft submitted to Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems.

1. The live script "Sec2_Deterministic_Parameterization.mlx" makes the plots and demonstrates several important calculations for Section 2 of this paper. 
2. The live script "Sec3_Stochastic_Parameterization.mlx" makes the plots and demonstrates several important calculations for Section 3 of this paper. 
3. Data for one snapshot, coarse grained to 1 degree is split across three files, "0013_01_05_1degree_a.mat", "0013_01_05_1degree_b.mat", 
   "0013_01_05_1degree_c.mat" to fit within github's file size restrictions 
4. The various Matlab scripts perform various diagnostic analyses of the data, as described in the paper.
